Rover version 2.02
==================

Rover is designed to provide a means of executing commands on remote
systems.  The Rover perl module manages connections to remote servers
and supplies an Expect object to other functions provided by extension
modules.  One of the key advantages of Rover is that it runs many
hosts in parallel, and keeps track of individual failures.

Several modules come with Rover to extend its functionality.  Included
with Rover are:

   Rover::Shell_Access_Routines
   Rover::Root_Access_Routines
   Rover::Run_Commands
   Rover::File_Transfer
   Rover::User_Admin
   Rover::Password

This should be all one needs to connect to a remote host via ssh, telnet,
or rlogin, get root via su or sudo, run commands, transfer files, add
or remove users, unlock accounts, and change passwords.

Rover comes with two frontend programs, rover and rovergtk.  The first,
rover, is ran interactively from the command line.  And rovergtk uses
the perl module Gtk to provide a graphical X user interface.

Rover, and its accompanying extension modules, are 100% perl and do
not require a C compiler to install.  However, depending on what
pre-requisites are installed, you may need to compile a few other
modules before installing Rover.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

These are several options you can supply to "perl Makefile.PL":

   --no-gtk            Do not install rovergtk, or check for Gtk
                       perl module.
   --no-deps           Do not check for dependencies, just install.
   --install-deps      Attempt to install dependencies via CPAN.

By default, "perl Makefile.PL" will check for dependencies and
exits if any are missing.  Using --install-deps will attempt to
install them using CPAN.  If CPAN has not been configured, you
may be prompted to do so.

DEPENDENCIES

If you want to run rover you must have these perl modules:

   IPC::SysV
   IO::Pty
   IO::Tty
   IO::Stty
   Expect

You can simply install Bundle::Expect via CPAN to satisfy most
of these requirements.  If your system doesnt already have
IPC::SysV, chances are you wont be able to run Rover at all.

If you wish to use the rovergtk frontend you also need:

  XML::Parser  (required by Gtk to build)
  XML::Writer  (required by Gtk to build)
  Gtk

See installation instructions if you wish to include the dependencies
with the install of Rover.
